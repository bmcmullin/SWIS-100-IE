    "## Introduction/motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "[WHOBS](https://github.com/PyPSA/WHOBS), and the associated interactive web application [model.energy](https://model.energy/), allows modelling of notionally optimised \"firm\" electricity generation for a given level of (constant/\"baseload\") capacity, based exclusively on *variable* renewable (VRE: here limited to wind and solar) sources, coupled with hydrogen and/or battery storage (to cover \"when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Wind and solar resource variability is configured for states within Europe using historical data from [Renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) ([model.energy](https://model.energy/) extends this coverage to global geographical locations using other data sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHOBS-IE-100** adapts WHOBS to model delivery of **100%** of electricity demand for one particular European country (**Ireland**), based on [historical load data](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/how-the-grid-works/renewables/) from the [Irish Transmission System Operator (TSO) eirgrid](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This result illustrates the (rough) trade-off between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw VRE *overprovision* (building more VRE capacity than can be directly dispatched at all times, but meaning that more demand can be covered directly by instantaneous VRE generations)\n",
    "- Dispatch down (discarding some generation when it is in excess of instantaneous load)\n",
    "- Storage (storing some generation when it is in excess of instantaneous load)\n",
    "    - Short term, high efficiency storage: battery\n",
    "    - Long term, low efficiency storage: hydrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "This toy model assumes a completely isolated grid (no external interconnection).\n"

    "## TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create/release as github project: add link in metadata block at top?\n",
    "+ Link to the [detailed caveats in the WHOBS README](https://github.com/PyPSA/WHOBS#warnings).\n",
    "+ Add more cautions/, including:\n",
    "    - *multi-annual* variability in generation and load\n",
    "    - constraint as well as curtailment \n",
    "    - system stability (traditional SNSP!) \n",
    "    - onshore wind only (offshore would be less variable but generally still more expensive)\n",
    "    - limited/no salt cavern underground storage within the IE jurisdiction (there is some in NI, but [currently targetted for NG storage!](https://www.infrastrataplc.com/projects/islandmagee-energy/)\n",
    "    - unclear whether the proposed (solved) wind and solar capacity is even feasible within the jurisdiction\n",
    "    - certain \"low carbon\", \"firm\" generation sources are deliberately omitted: nuclear, fossil fuel with CCS and bioenergy: it is likely that a (near) zero-$CO_2$ system could be achieved at lower cost by allowing such a wider range of options\n",
    "    - etc. etc...\n",
    "+ Batteries are allowed a tech-generic lifetime of 25 years (in assumptions .csv) - which seems a bit generous? Though may not change the results all that much...\n",
    "+ Add some (simplistic) model of interconnection: e.g. as a `StorageUnit` with `cyclic=True`, fixed `p_nom`, efficiency somewhat reflective of real IC losses (to UK/France). This is easier than trying to pick a price for a market import/export model (though it excludes nett exports as a trade opportunity...). Skates over the NI integration connection, which arguably deserves finer grained representation (given similar wind var profile).\n",
    "+ Add some representation of offshore wind as well as onshore; set `p_nom_extendable_max` for onshore, based on actual SEAI estimates. Note that offshore variability pattern is expected to be different from onshore (potential high capacity factor, absent dispatch down).\n",
    "+ Add some notional representation of grid losses (matching typical SEAI/Eirgrid levels?).\n",
    "+ Add some crude capability of changing average load level for target year (linear, exponential, whatever...)\n",
    "+ Add more flexible options on temporal resolution - not just 1 or 3 hours, but 6, 12, 24 hours?\n",
    "+ Add H2P OCGT (as well as CCGT)? Let `lopf()` optimise between OCGT and CCGT (will it all go to one?).\n",
    "+ Instead of a H2 steel tank storage being binary, leave it available unconditionally, but (optionally) set an `e_extendable_max` limit on H2 salt cavern underground storage (possibly loosely based on actual geology available in NI).\n",
    "+ Add a \"middle tier\" H2 storage option (between steel tank and salt cavern underground): [loosely based on ammonia tank storage](https://ammoniaindustry.com/ammonia-for-energy-storage-economic-and-technical-analysis/)?\n",
    "+ Of course, extending into heating and transport sectors is also on the agenda!\n",
    "+ Refactor the \"scenario\" concept:\n",
    "    - Incorporate `frequency` (properly, `time_resolution` or `time_step` or `snapshot_interval`?).\n",
    "    - Incorporate dispatch priority among VRE (solar/wind) as a scenario variable\n",
    "    - Currently \"hydrogen\" and \"hydrogen steel tank\" are effectively boolean scenario variables, though not expressly incorporated in the scenario mechanism/naming. Maybe make \"all\" the discrete technologies boolean in this sense, with a scenario tech substring something like: `WSHTB` (Wind|Solar|H2|Tank|Battery)?\n",
    "    - Refactor so that generic `network` only constructed once, and then specific details varied by scenario; should yield a little performance improvement/responsivity...\n",
    "+ Possibly refactor to remove the `ct` (\"country\"?) use? This is inherited from WHOBS, which genuinely has configuration capability for a variety of countries; but WHOBS-IE-100 really is hard-wired already for IE?\n",
    "+ Figure out/refactor exactly the way the plotting works...\n",
    "+ Refactor the import of third-party data files (Renewables.ninja and Eirgrid) to automate, with local caching...\n",
    "+ Create a single line diagram illustration (SLD)\n",
    "+ Screencast tutorial/explanation?\n"
