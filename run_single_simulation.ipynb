    "## Introduction/motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "[WHOBS](https://github.com/PyPSA/WHOBS), and the associated interactive web application [model.energy](https://model.energy/), allows modelling of notionally optimised \"firm\" electricity generation for a given level of (constant/\"baseload\") capacity, based exclusively on *variable* renewable (VRE: here limited to wind and solar) sources, coupled with hydrogen and/or battery storage (to cover \"when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Wind and solar resource variability is configured for states within Europe using historical data from [Renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) ([model.energy](https://model.energy/) extends this coverage to global geographical locations using other data sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHOBS-IE-100** adapts WHOBS to model delivery of **100%** of electricity demand from VRE only for one particular European country (**Ireland**), based on [historical load data](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/how-the-grid-works/renewables/) from the [Irish Transmission System Operator (TSO) eirgrid](http://www.eirgridgroup.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows illustration and exploration of the (rough) trade-off between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw VRE *overprovision* (building more VRE capacity than can be directly dispatched at all times, but meaning that more demand can be covered directly by instantaneous VRE generations)\n",
    "- Dispatch down (discarding some generation when it is in excess of instantaneous load)\n",
    "- Storage (storing some generation when it is in excess of instantaneous load)\n",
    "    - Short term, high efficiency storage: battery\n",
    "    - Long term, low efficiency storage: hydrogen\n",
    "- Interconnection with a larger, external, grid: here modelled (simplistically) as a single, aggregated, fixed power capacity link to an indefinitely large external energy storage (effectively it is assumed that a larger external grid will facilitate temporal buffering from the point of view of the local system, in a manner analogous to local storage, constrained only by the power capacity and efficiency of the interconnector(s) themselves). \n"

    "## Enhancements over WHOBS?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Added (crude) representation of external interconnection\n",
    "+ Added more flexible options on temporal resolution - not just 1 or 3 hours, but arbitrary number of hours\n",
    "+ Added/refactored mechanism for flexibly setting options for a particular interactive model run, capturing the summary results, and accumulating the information on these runs in two data structures, `run_configs` and `ru_stats`.\n",
    "+ Instead of H2 underground vs steel tank storage being mutually exclusive, both are made available for deployment unconditionally, but user can (optionally) set `e_extendable_max` limits on each separately (which could potentially be based, even if loosely, on actual available geology, such as salt caverns in NI).\n",
    "+ Similarly, H2 overall is available for deployment unconditionally: but obviously if both storage options are set to zero capacity, no actual H2 electrolysis or electricity generation will actually be provisioned.\n"

    "## TODO?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create/release as github project: add link in metadata block at top?\n",
    "+ Need to **critically** investigate the summary statistic here labelled as \"LCOE\" (in `run_stats`): it's not clear that that is actually what it represents (if not, what is it? and how **can** LCOE be calculated?).\n",
    "+ Bypass `pyomo` to improve solver performance? (I don't think there is anything in this model that *requires* `pyomo`?). Would require (modest) recoding of `extra_functionality`?\n",
    "+ Link to the [detailed caveats in the WHOBS README](https://github.com/PyPSA/WHOBS#warnings).\n",
    "+ Add more cautions/, including:\n",
    "    - \"Optimisation\" based on *notional* cost projections and *perfect* knowledge!?\n",
    "    - *multi-annual* variability in generation and load\n",
    "    - constraint as well as curtailment \n",
    "    - system stability (traditional SNSP!) \n",
    "    - onshore wind only (offshore would be less variable but generally still more expensive)\n",
    "    - limited/no salt cavern underground storage within the IE jurisdiction? There is some in NI, but [currently targetted for NG](https://www.infrastrataplc.com/projects/islandmagee-energy/) or [compressed air (CAES)](https://www.energy-storage.news/news/gaelectric-gains-8.3-million-eu-funding-for-caes-project) energy storage (albeit the [latter project is now defunct](http://irishenergyblog.blogspot.com/2018/01/gaelectric-to-wind-down.html)).\n",
    "    - unclear whether the proposed (solved) wind and solar capacity is even feasible within the jurisdiction\n",
    "    - certain \"low carbon\", \"firm\" generation sources are deliberately omitted: nuclear, fossil fuel with CCS and bioenergy: it is likely that a (near) zero-$CO_2$ system could be achieved at lower cost by allowing such a wider range of options\n",
    "    - etc. etc...\n",
    "+ Batteries are allowed a tech-generic lifetime of 25 years (in assumptions .csv) - which seems a bit generous? Though may not change the results all that much...\n",
    "+ Conversely, interconnection is also allowed the same tech-generic lifetime of 25 years - which seems possibly a bit short...\n",
    "+ Add some representation of offshore wind as well as onshore; set `p_nom_extendable_max` for onshore, based on actual SEAI estimates. Note that offshore variability pattern is expected to be different from onshore (potential high capacity factor, absent dispatch down): but this *is* available via renewables ninja.\n",
    "+ Add some notional representation of grid losses (matching typical SEAI/Eirgrid levels?).\n",
    "+ Add some crude capability of changing average load level for target year (linear, exponential, whatever...)\n",
    "+ Add H2P OCGT (as well as CCGT)? Let `lopf()` optimise between OCGT and CCGT (will it all go to one?).\n",
    "+ Add a \"middle tier\" H2 storage option (between steel tank and salt cavern underground): [loosely based on ammonia tank storage](https://ammoniaindustry.com/ammonia-for-energy-storage-economic-and-technical-analysis/)?\n",
    "+ Of course, extending into heating and transport sectors is also on the agenda!\n",
    "+ Incorporate dispatch priority among VRE (solar/wind) as a scenario variable\n",
    "+ Capture (somehow?) into run_stats the solver \"wallclock time\" for each run. This obviously ideosyncratic as it depends on the specific hardware platform ... so one would ideally capture some hardware platform specs as well. ;-)\n",
    "+ Refactor so that generic `network` only constructed once, and then specific details varied by scenario; should yield a little performance improvement/responsivity...\n",
    "+ Possibly refactor to remove the `ct` (\"country\"?) use? This is inherited from WHOBS, which genuinely has configuration capability for a variety of countries; but WHOBS-IE-100 really is hard-wired already for IE?\n",
    "+ Figure out/refactor exactly the way the plotting works...\n",
    "+ Refactor the import of third-party data files (Renewables.ninja and Eirgrid) to automate, with local caching...\n",
    "+ Generalise to command-line version as well as jupyter notebook (also incorporating automated `snakemake` experimental setups) as per original WHOBS.\n",
    "+ Create a single line diagram illustration (SLD)\n",
    "+ Screencast tutorial/explanation?\n"
