# Informal/preliminary notes on installing/running SWIS-100-IE on MS-Windows

+ CBC install on windows is not trivial - even though just one file (cbc.exe) is actually needed!

+ conda (in the form of miniconda) gives us a full python system
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

+ And glpk can be installed with conda!
https://groups.google.com/g/pypsa/c/07ZjYkxj3ic/m/A6ZNfGF4AAAJ
conda install -c conda-forge glpk

+ binder\environment.yml will drive conda to install everything else needed

(Actually ... surely can include glpk there also?)

+ Tailored windows/command.exe postBuild.bat can get the datasets; but needs manual install of wget.exe first (without using wget.exe to get it!)

+ But look: curl should be native on Win-10, and can substitute for wget?
